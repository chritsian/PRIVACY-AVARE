API Log Plugin
--------------------------

The API Log plugin writes log entries for camera and microphone API calls to the apiLog.txt file.

Usage: 
1. push the file apiLogPlugin.apk to your phone
2. start AVARE Box
3. click 'Add App'
4. install the plugin
5. start the app you want to monitor via AVARE BOX
6. read the apiLog.txt

If you want to reset the log file just delete it. A new file is created automatically.

Actual logged APIs:

- Camera (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera)
- camera2 (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary)
- MediaRecorder (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder)
- AudioRecord (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioRecord)
