The benchmark plugin writes log entries for camera and microphone API calls to the benchmarkLog.txt file.

Usage: 
1. push the file benchmarkPlugin.apk to your phone
2. start AVARE Box
3. Click Add App
4. install the plugin
5. start the app you want to monitor via AVARE BOX
6. read the benchmarkLog.txt
If you want to reset the log file just delete it. A new file is created automatically.

Actual logged APIs:

- Camera (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/camera)
- camera2 (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary)
- MediaRecorder (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder)
